                <p>A <strong>zero-day</strong> (also known as <strong>0-day</strong>) is a computer-software <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability_(computing)" title="">vulnerability</a> unknown to those who should be interested in its mitigation (including the vendor of the target software). Until the vulnerability is mitigated, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker" title="Security and safety features new to Windows Vista">hackers</a> can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)" title="">exploit</a> it to adversely affect programs, data, additional computers or a network.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"></sup> An exploit directed at a zero-day is called a <strong>zero-day exploit</strong>, or <strong>zero-day attack.</strong></p>
<p>The term "zero-day" originally referred to the number of days since a new piece of software was released to the public, so "zero-day software" was obtained by hacking into a developer's computer before release. Eventually the term was applied to the vulnerabilities that allowed this hacking, and to the number of days that the vendor has had to fix them.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"></sup> Once the vendor learns of the vulnerability, they will usually create <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)" title="Patch (computing)">patches</a> or advise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaround" title="Workaround">workarounds</a> to mitigate it.</p>
<p>The more recently that the vendor has become aware of the vulnerability, the more likely it is that no fix or mitigation has been developed. Once a fix is developed, the chance of the exploit succeeding decreases as more users apply the fix over time. For zero-day exploits, unless the vulnerability is inadvertently fixed, such as by an unrelated update that happens to fix the vulnerability, the probability that a user has applied a vendor-supplied patch that fixes the problem is zero, so the exploit would remain available.

<p>KDMapper is a simple tool that exploits iqvw64e.sys Intel driver to manually map non-signed drivers in memory</p>
<p>Fixups:</p>
<div class="snippet-clipboard-content position-relative">
<pre><code>Hook "NtQueryInformationAtom" which exists in all windows versions
Fixed unable to load /GS- compiled drivers
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Improvements:</p>
<div class="snippet-clipboard-content position-relative">
<pre><code>Implemented NtLoadDriver and NtUnloadDriver for less traces
Prevent load if \Device\Nal exists (Prevents BSOD)
Automatic clear PiDDBCacheTable
Header section skipped while copying driver to kernel
Automatic clear g_KernelHashBucketList
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<div class="snippet-clipboard-content position-relative">
<pre><code>Set Custom Driver Entry Point
Create a thread and return from driver entry fastest as you can to prevent unexpected calls
</code></pre>

    The Project T is a Threat Emulation and Red Teaming Framework built to be easy to use.
<br>
<br>The Project T is Feature Rich! Including, Keystroke Logging, Reflective DLL Injection, Reverse Shell, Password Recovery, etc.
<br>Remote Hacker Probe Core is open source and constantly improved. and is no longer being updated or worked on.
<br>Fast and Lightweight, Remote Hacker Probe is coded in Java meaning it will run anywhere in a JRE and Client in C++ for Native Windows.
<br>The Remote Hacker Probe had 2 versions, Open Source and Professional Version. That have been merged into one and the source code of the Professional Version is also now open source. For more information click here.
<br>
<br>Please do not use the Project T or any Software for Black Hat Activity. The Remote Hacker Probe is made for Authorized Penetration testing, Demonstrations and Reasearch. The Author is not responsible for any sort of misuse or damage caused by the program.
<br>
<br>Thanks for&nbsp;
