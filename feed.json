Eventually the term was applied to the vulnerabilities that allowed this hacking, and to the number of days that the vendor has had to fix them.<sup id=\"cite_ref-2\" class=\"reference\"></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-3\" class=\"reference\"></sup><sup id=\"cite_ref-4\" class=\"reference\"></sup> Once the vendor learns of the vulnerability, they will usually create <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)\" title=\"Patch (computing)\">patches</a> or advise <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaround\" title=\"Workaround\">workarounds</a> to mitigate it.</p>\n<p>The more recently that the vendor has become aware of the vulnerability, the more likely it is that no fix or mitigation has been developed. Once a fix is developed, the chance of the exploit succeeding decreases as more users apply the fix over time. For zero-day exploits, unless the vulnerability is inadvertently fixed, such as by an unrelated update that happens to fix the vulnerability, the probability that a user has applied a vendor-supplied patch that fixes the problem is zero, so the exploit would remain available.
